Part of the measure of success for the position will be whether the selections made throughout the project lifecycle result in long term stability and excellent performance from a user perspective.
Candidate will be on call supporting mission critical systems 7x24. They will need to make what can be widely-impacting decisions on their own, in the middle of the night and while under great pressure. These decisions have a direct effect on availability and integrity of the databases we support. Anxiety runs high on problem bridges so the ability to stay calm and arrive at the best possible decision in the shortest amount of time is essential. They will have a significant amount of independence during these occurrences which is another reason technical knowledge and the ability to apply it is so important.
