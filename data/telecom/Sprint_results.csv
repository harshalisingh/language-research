Virgin is one of the worldâ€™s most recognized and beloved brands. It represents inspiration, innovation, and changing business in a way that makes the world a better place. Itâ€™s a culture where people find a way to say â€œyesâ€ù to bold ideas. Virgin Mobile USA brings the â€œVirgin Wayâ€ù to wireless. It has always been a disruptive force, and as the industry evolves, we are pushing to stay ahead. There has never been a better time to join Virgin Mobile as we are in the middle of evolving the brand and the way we do business to once again drive real change and innovation. Why do consumers love their phones and their apps, but not their carriers? Itâ€™s because carriers are boring, even utility-like. Virgin Mobile is everything but a carrier or a utility. It brings a way of living and an experience to wireless that others canâ€™t seem to replicate. We are looking for individuals who can fully embrace the Virgin philosophy and use it to make a difference in the world, who want to blow away customer expectations, and who live to pursue a mission in life as opposed to a corporate career. If you think you've got this passion and want to be part of a team of like-minded individuals, check us out. Weâ€™re excited to meet you!
