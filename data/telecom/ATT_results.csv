Description of position
ECOMP represents a fundamental change in how we will control and manage our networks. While existing operational capabilities may be sufficient to manage individual ECOMP components, proper functioning of ECOMP will depend on cross-component interactions that must be understood and managed. The role of this position will be to invent, build and deploy new operational technology needed to provide a cross-component ECOMP view, understand the end-to-end service performance of ECOMP, expose the ECOMP service topology in order to support service isolation, and enable rapid troubleshooting and resolution of cross-component issues. This new technology will reduce OpEx by automating ECOMP operations, and it will improve overall AT&T customer experience for ECOMP operated services by reducing disruptions in ECOMP and minimizing resolution times when they do occur.
Why this position is critical
While ECOMP and D2 will allow rapid service creation and enable operational savings, the complexity of the new technology we are deploying will bring with it new and significant operational challenges. The ability to effectively understand, manage and address end-to-end cross-component interactions in ECOMP will be critical to realizing the benefits of ECOMP and D2 (i.e., reduced operational cost and improved service delivery.) With the recent loss of key personnel in my organization, we are short staffed to deliver on this vision.
Outstanding individuals with a Ph.D. or equivalent in computer science, engineering, or applied sciences are encouraged to apply. Candidates must demonstrate excellence in research, strong technical and thought leadership skills, a collaborative spirit, strong communication skills, software and systems expertise, and possess a strong passion to make a difference and impact real world systems.

Description of position
ECOMP represents a fundamental change in how we will control and manage our networks. While existing operational capabilities may be sufficient to manage individual ECOMP components, proper functioning of ECOMP will depend on cross-component interactions that must be understood and managed. The role of this position will be to invent, build and deploy new operational technology needed to provide a cross-component ECOMP view, understand the end-to-end service performance of ECOMP, expose the ECOMP service topology in order to support service isolation, and enable rapid troubleshooting and resolution of cross-component issues. This new technology will reduce OpEx by automating ECOMP operations, and it will improve overall AT&T customer experience for ECOMP operated services by reducing disruptions in ECOMP and minimizing resolution times when they do occur.
Why this position is critical
While ECOMP and D2 will allow rapid service creation and enable operational savings, the complexity of the new technology we are deploying will bring with it new and significant operational challenges. The ability to effectively understand, manage and address end-to-end cross-component interactions in ECOMP will be critical to realizing the benefits of ECOMP and D2 (i.e., reduced operational cost and improved service delivery.) With the recent loss of key personnel in my organization, we are short staffed to deliver on this vision.
Outstanding individuals with a Ph.D. or equivalent in computer science, engineering, or applied sciences are encouraged to apply. Candidates must demonstrate excellence in research, strong technical and thought leadership skills, a collaborative spirit, strong communication skills, software and systems expertise, and possess a strong passion to make a difference and impact real world systems.

We are a pioneer in big data technologies ‰ÛÒ developing novel methodologies for statistical computing, event prediction, fraud detection, visualization, text mining, data stream management, data quality and anomaly detection, and privacy preserving measures such as data anonymization.
We have an immediate need for a PhD level Statistician with a passion for extracting insights from data to join our Statistics Research Department. We work on problems from all aspects of AT&T‰Ûªs business, including new service creation, network design and optimization, marketing and customer care. These challenging business problems offer opportunities to establish external recognition while creating state-of-the-art, business-impacting solutions. You will make a difference: to our customers and employees by improving their experience; to our stakeholders by developing cost-effective solutions; and to the academic community as you contribute novel methodology or open source software that address real-world problems.
Our Research Lab enjoys a highly collaborative and academic environment, encouraging experimentation and innovation. Project roles are fluid ‰ÛÒ anyone can be the project lead or team member. Many researchers work directly with business unit leaders, and developing algorithms and solutions can be an interactive experience with them. Primary location can be Bedminster, NJ or New York, NY.
Desired areas of expertise
- Text mining - AT&T is modeling free-form text from millions of customer surveys, representative notes, and chats as one way to manage our business in real time. New methods are needed to keep up with the volume and complexity of this data.
- Spatiotemporal analysis of mobile data - The AT&T network generates billions of records per day from handheld devices, each one providing a data point in time and space. Understanding the dynamics of this data through time series and spatial statistics helps AT&T better serve its customers, improve its network, and develop new products and services.
- Predictive Modeling ‰ÛÒ We estimate models to predict customer behavior and sentiment, service disruptions, and event impacts. Models serve to both target, and to gain insight into variable relationships. Our rich customer and network data allows analysts to positively affect business outcomes and to pursue methodological research (comparing machine learning algorithms, for example).
- Statistical computation - AT&T is developing high-performance statistical models and algorithms (mostly in R) to leverage modern streaming and storage technologies. One example is the AT&T collaborative coding project RCloud http://rcloud.social/.
Qualifications
