Within BBA, the Broadband Access Copper Product Team (PT) is responsible for driving the overall copper business and technology leadership and continuing to maintain the #1 position in worldwide DSL market. The Copper PT leverages its innovations to maximize the value of our customer‰ЫЄs copper based access networks. In addition to the traditional chassis based ETSI DSL platforms, there is a growing portfolio of micro-nodes with fiber point-to-point and PON uplinks. The copper technologies range across ADSL, SHDSL, VDSL2, vectoring, Vplus, G.fast and XG-FAST. The mission of Copper Product line management organization is to define the product strategy and the roadmap of DSL product lines. An ISAM Copper PLM is responsible for the co-ordination of the commercial and technical aspects of specific domains of DSL products with the target of preserving, building, growing and maximizing the commercial success of the Copper Product Line. In this role, a PLM is responsible for defining all aspects of specific product domains: roadmap, technical content, cost structure and target market, to ensure successful product introduction and continued market leadership. To this end, he/she interacts with various departments such as R&D, operations, (product) marketing, Bell Labs, support, training, tendering, sales and CTO. In order to align his/her product with the market requirements, he/she uses various sources of information such as customer contacts, standardization, analyst reports, competitive analysis and legislation. Out of all this noise/uncertainty, he/she should be able to prioritize and distil trends/requirements and set the right product roadmap within the overall strategy. As PLM you will be responsible for one or multiple domains, and within each domain you will perform all of the following activities: - Define worldwide domain product roadmap for Nokia ISAM.

This requires building a sound understanding of market intelligence, customer demand, and strategic differentiators, on a worldwide basis. - Be the prime driving force in the organization for the successful introduction of new features in the domain to all customers worldwide, across all dimensions, including frequent communication to all customers worldwide, customer demos and workshops worldwide, provide assistance in answering to RFPs (technical) and RFQs (including price strategy) to customers worldwide in support of tendering when needed, any technical issues that arise during the development process, building of an own view on the worldwide board volumes during the first months of introduction and work with sales and operations to align the forecast with this own view. - As an Agile Area Product Owner (APO) interact on a day to day basis with R&D on technical requirements, feature description and fundamental technical options, and review R&D deliverables that impact the market fit of the product. An ability for independent evaluation and assessment of both technical and non-technical risks and navigating decisions, product direction and execution through those risks towards a successful outcome. - Continuously monitor the evolution and the behavior of direct competitors and interpret the possible consequences for Nokia products and initiate roadmap changes as required. Since it is Nokia‰ЫЄs ambition to keep one step ahead of its direct competitors it is imperative that these analyses allow a proactive market oriented mindset and behavior instead of a reactive input. For this specific requisition, the focus is on a PLM that will take up one or multiple domains in the xDSL area. This area includes: - Software features related to new xDSL features, on request of customers and/or to follow standardization evolution - improvements in the vectoring area, with an initial focus on extending the availability and feature scope of vectoring to more of our hardware platforms, across the different modes (board-level, system-level and cross-DSLAM-level) and physical layer technologies (17a, 35b, G.fast), taking into account the links with other adjacent features (like bonding, ..) and assuring the non-functional requirements (like performance, stability, initialization time, ..) - Software features related to the management of xDSL features, with protocols such as SNMP, CLI/TL1, and Netconf/Yang The specific domain(s) will be determined in interaction with the applicant. In your role, you will form part of the worldwide virtual team of xDSL PLMs, which is coordinated by the xDSL strategist.

The Nokia equipment (7x50 SR and ESS product line) enables carriers to build converged infrastructure for residential Triple play with IPTV, business Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) and mobile networks which hitherto used to be three separate networks. It employs state of the art technologies like Hierarchical QOS, Layer 2 VPNs, Advanced Ethernet Operations, Administration and Maintenance (OAM), and Subscriber management per service. The product platforms allow companies to use legacy infrastructure so that investments already made are useful, and provide inter-working migration paths with legacy technologies like ATM and TDM. Simultaneous inter-working of so many specialized technologies and features makes these proprietary products complex to design and build. Carrier Ethernet is still an emerging area with difficult technical problems to be solved, which require specialized knowledge and experience from early customer deployments. Residential End user applications like IPTV, Video on Demand and VoIP impose enormous bandwidth demands, and in a converged infrastructure it becomes important to offer customer varied service level agreements (SLAs) and ensure that the SLAs can be met. This requires complex features and technologies inter-working seamlessly, which also place pressing demands on scalability, performance, and resiliency. Developing the proprietary product for these complex feature sets requires engineers with expertise in architecture and design as well as excellent coding skills; not only for desired functionality, but also for scalability, performance and resiliency.

The Nokia equipment (7x50 SR and ESS product line) enables carriers to build converged infrastructure for residential Triple play with IPTV, business Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) and mobile networks which hitherto used to be three separate networks. It employs state of the art technologies like Hierarchical QOS, Layer 2 VPNs, Advanced Ethernet Operations, Administration and Maintenance (OAM), and Subscriber management per service. The product platforms allow companies to use legacy infrastructure so that investments already made are useful, and provide inter-working migration paths with legacy technologies like ATM and TDM. Simultaneous inter-working of so many specialized technologies and features makes these proprietary products complex to design and build. Carrier Ethernet is still an emerging area with difficult technical problems to be solved, which require specialized knowledge and experience from early customer deployments. Residential End user applications like IPTV, Video on Demand and VoIP impose enormous bandwidth demands, and in a converged infrastructure it becomes important to offer customer varied service level agreements (SLAs) and ensure that the SLAs can be met. This requires complex features and technologies inter-working seamlessly, which also place pressing demands on scalability, performance, and resiliency. Developing the proprietary product for these complex feature sets requires engineers with expertise in architecture and design as well as excellent coding skills; not only for desired functionality, but also for scalability, performance and resiliency.
