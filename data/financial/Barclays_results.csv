In response, they created a new company called Barclaycard. We launched the UKâ€™s first credit card, and in the years that followed Barclaycard grew rapidly: through new technologies like mobile and contactless, and into new markets around the globe. Today, Barclaycard is one of the leading payment providers in the world. From small beginnings in Northampton, weâ€™ve built a team of 11,000 employees serving 36 million customers worldwide. Barclaycard is now the leading credit card issuer in the UK, Germany, Spain, Italy, Portugal and the Nordics â€“ and weâ€™re just getting started. Weâ€™re pursuing our goal to make Barclaycard the â€˜Go-Toâ€™ choice for consumer payments. Youâ€™ll find Barclaycard on both sides of a transaction. We provide shoppers with credit cards, loans, and innovative new forms of payment, and we provide sellers with the technology to accept and process payments. In 2013, we processed over Â£235bn in transactions. From the beginning, the Barclaycard story has been one of innovation â€“ from the UKâ€™s first credit card and cash machine to the first mobile and contactless technology. We were the first company to give women a credit card in their own name, and the first to create a card thatâ€™s managed by members through an online community â€“ Barclaycard Ring. It all started with a card, but these days weâ€™re looking past plastic. Weâ€™re exploring new ways to pay, including wearable technologies like bPay band and products like bFlex, which lets you finance a purchase at the point of sale. In short, weâ€™re not standing still. Because just like we did in 1966, weâ€™re here to make things easier for everyone [For all perm job adverts except for the US where the mandatory EEO statement must be included please include the following statement â€œWe are an equal opportunity employer and we are opposed to discrimination on any grounds.â€ù or local/legislative Diversity and Inclusion wording] Overall purpose of role We are looking for an experienced Senior Software Engineer to join the engineering team.

Department overview Global Information Security is a global team with more than 700 colleagues across Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas. We support the business in ensuring the confidentially, integrity and availability of Barclaysâ€™ information assets, and in implementing world-class security solutions to meet business needs. Cybercrime and cyber-attacks against institutions are growing considerably in quality, quantity, and complexity, targeting both private industry and national critical infrastructure. Successful attacks against organizations can result in significant disruptions to business transactions, operations, and client activities, as well as regulatory scrutiny, reputational harm and brand tarnishment. As a global bank, Barclays is at the crosshair of cyber criminals. As an organization that process financial transactions, stores and transmits sensitive client information, and participates in the global financial marketplace, Barclays is an attractive target to organized criminals, hackers and hacktivists. Barclays can expect to see a continued increase in the number and sophistication of cyber-attacks against it, its partners, and its employees and clients. This is made more of a critical issue given the bankâ€™s strategy of providing more and more of its services and products online and via mobile channels. The developments described above require a different and much more proactive and intelligence led cyber defence, compared to the normal reactive and incident based defences built over the last 20 years. The modern Cyber Security Group uses, among other things, useful intelligence from multiple sources to attempt to understand the motives and tactics of attackers before an attack happens, as well as react to attacks as they occur. An effective Cyber Security Group will be able to effectively plan, predict, detect, prevent, react, respond and recover from multiple attacks in short time frames.

In response, they created a new company called Barclaycard. We launched the UKâ€™s first credit card, and in the years that followed Barclaycard grew rapidly: through new technologies like mobile and contactless, and into new markets around the globe. Today, Barclaycard is one of the leading payment providers in the world. From small beginnings in Northampton, weâ€™ve built a team of 11,000 employees serving 36 million customers worldwide. Barclaycard is now the leading credit card issuer in the UK, Germany, Spain, Italy, Portugal and the Nordics â€“ and weâ€™re just getting started. Weâ€™re pursuing our goal to make Barclaycard the â€˜Go-Toâ€™ choice for consumer payments. Youâ€™ll find Barclaycard on both sides of a transaction. We provide shoppers with credit cards, loans, and innovative new forms of payment, and we provide sellers with the technology to accept and process payments. In 2013, we processed over Â£235bn in transactions. From the beginning, the Barclaycard story has been one of innovation â€“ from the UKâ€™s first credit card and cash machine to the first mobile and contactless technology. We were the first company to give women a credit card in their own name, and the first to create a card thatâ€™s managed by members through an online community â€“ Barclaycard Ring. It all started with a card, but these days weâ€™re looking past plastic. Weâ€™re exploring new ways to pay, including wearable technologies like bPay band and products like bFlex, which lets you finance a purchase at the point of sale. In short, weâ€™re not standing still. Because just like we did in 1966, weâ€™re here to make things easier for everyone.

Risk and Control Objective Ensure that all activities and duties are carried out in full compliance with regulatory requirements, Barclays Operational Risk Framework and internal Barclays Policies and Standards. Department Overview Global Information Security is a global team with more than 700 colleagues across Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas. We support the business in ensuring the confidentially, integrity and availability of Barclaysâ€™ information assets, and in implementing world-class security solutions to meet business needs. Cybercrime and cyber-attacks against institutions are growing considerably in quality, quantity, and complexity, targeting both private industry and national critical infrastructure. Successful attacks against organizations can result in significant disruptions to business transactions, operations, and client activities, as well as regulatory scrutiny, reputational harm and brand tarnishment. As a global bank, Barclays is at the crosshair of cyber criminals. As an organization that process financial transactions, stores and transmits sensitive client information, and participates in the global financial marketplace, Barclays is an attractive target to organized criminals, hackers and hacktivists. Barclays can expect to see a continued increase in the number and sophistication of cyber-attacks against it, its partners, and its employees and clients. This is made more of a critical issue given the bankâ€™s strategy of providing more and more of its services and products online and via mobile channels. The developments described above require a different and much more proactive and intelligence led cyber defense, compared to the normal reactive and incident based defenses built over the last 20 years. The modern Cyber Security Group uses, among other things, useful intelligence from multiple sources to attempt to understand the motives and tactics of attackers before an attack happens, as well as react to attacks as they occur. An effective Cyber Security Group will be able to effectively plan, predict, detect, prevent, react, respond and recover from multiple attacks in short time frames. Main Duties GIS Intelligenceâ€™s mission is to acquire knowledge about adversaries, their motivations, intentions and methods; to collect this information, analyse and disseminate in a timely and appropriate way in order to protect Barclaysâ€™ its clients and partners. GIS Intelligenceâ€™s role includes centralising and coordinating all intelligence functions within GIS by providing timely, actionable, and high quality intelligence in support of critical operations globally. To properly protect Barclays against cyber-attacks all the three elements cyber deterrence are required to support by the intelligence mission: Attribution, Defence and Retaliation.
