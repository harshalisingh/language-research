We need highly skilled professionals who thrive in a challenging environment, and are curious and tenacious when it comes to solving problems be they technical or data related. We do more than software development. Engineering is a mindset where we take responsibility for continuous improvement, delivery of product outcomes, and awareness of the cost implications of our decisions. We look for people to speak up when things aren't right, fix what's broken, but most of all to exemplify a determination to innovate and create. We need Systems Engineers with a solid Linux background and recent experience of large scale cluster operations. Demonstrable experience with modern software defined infrastructure practices is essential. Production experience with Hadoop and/or Docker workloads, and infrastructure related open source contributions are advantageous. Skills & Requirements We recognize many systems professionals joined the industry directly and may not have formal education in Computer Science or Engineering; we welcome all applicants provided they demonstrate an appreciation for CS/E foundations; i.e. evidence-based decision making and taking responsibility for outcomes. Applied to Systems Engineering and DevOps this is an ability to develop solutions that are elegant, pragmatic, principled and robust. Candidates are expected to have developed a breadth of knowledge and an ability to learn, regardless of and indeed beyond their formal education. We view Systems Engineering as being distinct from Systems Administration; a deep knowledge of Linux internals, the challenges of distributed systems, something of the artiste when troubleshooting & problem solving, and a deep awareness of the shifting realities in systems operations are necessary grounding. Beyond that we look for people who believe they can change the system, not just make it run. Operations experience must be coupled with strong software development proficiency. We expect fluency in C; Bash scripting is a given (though you should probably know better); and ability in one or more of Perl, Python, Ruby, Rust, or Go. Writing Java is not required but experience running in production at scale is essential. Awareness of functional programming is hoped for; actual experience with Haskell or Scala extremely well regarded. About Us We bring data together from disparate sources across the bank and turn it into meaningful information by doing machine learning and predictive analytics. We are one of the largest employers of functional programmers in Australia. Our work environment is stimulating with small squads working in product-oriented teams. Our Software Engineers are responsible for the core system, written in Scala with supporting tooling written in Haskell. Our Data Scientists carry out analysis with Python and R, all running on Hadoop. Our Systems Engineers make it work and keep it working, correctly and fast.
