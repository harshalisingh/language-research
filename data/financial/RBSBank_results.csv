"Risk Delivery Change Manager","The Business
This is an outstanding opportunity for a strong change or programme manager with a track record of delivery to take on responsibility for intriguing, bank wide projects with great internal and external visibility. Join our Enterprise Wide Risk Management function as Stress Testing Delivery Change Manager, and you'll get a great overview across one of Europe's largest and most complex financial services organisations, along with challenging work to take your career forward.
Enterprise Wide Risk (EWR) deals with risks that manifest themselves at the aggregate level of the bank. So we take a strategic, bank-wide view of risk management.
We manage areas like capital and liquidity risk, which are entity driven (rather than pure credit, market or operational risk views), as well as risk appetite and policy framework which apply across the bank globally. We are a centre of expertise for all centralised risk model development activity, from stress testing to capital adequacy. We also own the end-to-end risk management framework, how it fits together, and work on its adoption and consistent application across the bank. This makes us a key area in delivering security to both customers and shareholders.
What you'll do
Stress testing is an area of huge focus both inside the bank and with some of our most important external stakeholders. We complete stress tests at our regulators' request, but we also use them as a tool to assess the risks inherent in the types of business we choose to engage in, and make major strategic decisions. All of this will give the team's work real visibility and great importance.
Reporting to the Head of Stress Testing Delivery, this role will see you leading stress testing change and enhancement initiatives across the bank. Your role will include ongoing PMO of change and enhancement activity, includes sizing existing risk issues – the source of which could be Audit, QA, or regulatory – through discussion with multiple stakeholders both in the franchises, and in risk, finance and treasury teams. There are numerous workstreams which will go towards completing the task, and as a dedicated Change Manager you'll have the significant responsibility of coordinating them all, including design and maintenance of the overall project plan with a specific focus on change and enhancements both for the short and long term. It's a vital role which will see you take on a broad set of stakeholders, from colleagues within your immediate team to subject matter experts and senior management throughout our customer businesses, and on to our external regulators, who you'll have direct contact with, and for whom you'll coordinate business streams to provide our response to requests.
Ultimately, you'll be responsible for making sure that the necessary changes and enhancements are implemented on time. It's a sizeable and essential task with great visibility to senior stakeholders across the bank, and could kick your career on to the next level.
What you'll bring
This is an important and high profile piece of work with significant time pressures, and you will need to be motivated by the challenge. You'll need a background in a change management or PMO environment, and should be delivery focused and able to demonstrate the ability to successfully lead large scale risk or finance projects.
While you don’t need a detailed understanding of the practicalities of stress testing, you should have a good high level overview and a competent understanding of the regulatory and financial consequences of failures in stress testing processes. The team's task is multi-functional, so you should also have an understanding of how areas such as Risk, Finance, Treasury, and Capital Management all interact.
Communication, people management and influencing skills are essential, as you'll be reliant on the buy-in and cooperation of a broad range of contributors and stakeholders to deliver.
As a Financial Services organisation we comply with and support the requirements set by our Regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which are designed to protect our customers. This role falls under Conduct Rules of the Individual Accountability Regime (IAR) and is subject to pre-employment screening.

"Infrastructure Risk Oversight Manager (2 year contract)","The Business
If you can bring both a detailed understanding of technology and a firm grounding in technology risk and control, this is a role with real breadth, depth and complexity. Our technology space is constantly changing and evolving, and as part of our Technology Risk Oversight team you'll have exposure to the bank's full global infrastructure estate. Your role will be crucial in helping us identify, understand, assess, and control technology risks across the bank, and in protecting business critical services.
We're looking for two people, and have the flexibility to hire at either a managerial level or as a senior analyst. This role is available on a fixed two year contract.
Operational Risk plays a leadership role in delivering a forward-looking, robust risk management culture across the whole bank. To do so, we maintain the knowledge that allows us to provide both specialist expertise in areas like fraud, security and technology, as well as giving general operational risk management guidance to all our businesses. We also maintain an operational risk management framework that enables our people to consistently identify, assess, manage, monitor, and report on the risks we face.
What you'll do
In the world of contemporary banking, technology underpins almost every interaction we have with our customers, our colleagues, and with regulators and other bodies, so it's essential that we manage the risks inherent in our infrastructure effectively. As we go through an extensive period of business and technology transformation, it's more important than ever that the our technology risks are well controlled.
This role will place you at the centre of that transformation, giving you an integral part to play in identifying, understanding, and mitigating risks to our technology infrastructure. Through your technology expertise, strong research and analysis, you’ll build an understanding of technology risk which allows you provide credible challenge and assurance on our risk management, and provide a crucial, evolving overview for senior management.
Technology risk related to core infrastructure services, service delivery and IT management (including strategy, budget, vendor and people management), will all feature as part of your remit. You'll work with both the technology and the business teams; getting inside their risk frameworks and how they manage risks during critical, highly technical activities such as moving the location of data mainframes. While completing deep dive and themed reviews, you'll apply your influencing skills to gather insight, considering the risk profile to provide expert support and guidance on the bank's IT risk and control frameworks.
What you'll bring
A role of this importance in managing our technology dependencies requires someone with a deep practical technical knowledge, and you'll need experience in one or more of:
The design, deployment and operations of enterprise technology infrastructure (networks, storage, server, mainframe and/or mid-range)
An IT function which includes vendor (product and outsourcing), resourcing, financial, strategic, and programme or project management
ITIL service management and delivery procedures and practices, including Incident, Problem and Change Management processes
You should balance your technical expertise with exposure to risk management, giving you a strong understanding of operational risk management policies and frameworks. We'll also expect you to demonstrate a strong record of analytical and problem solving capabilities, and to be committed to your own personal development; you can expect our support in your continued development in return.
Strong interpersonal and stakeholder management skills will be essential to your success. You should have excellent written and verbal communication skills, as well as strong influencing skills and a creative approach in supporting the business with alternative solutions. At the same time, you'll also need to demonstrate a clear track record in delivering multiple activities to tight deadlines.
How we'll reward you
In return, we offer a competitive salary plus an additional cash and benefit funding programme that can be tailored to suit your individual needs. In addition, we provide a wide selection of exclusive lifestyle offers, development and learning programmes, services and support designed to help you manage and balance your work/life priorities.

"Implementation Manager, Specialist Banking","The Business
If you have the ability to influence senior stakeholders and drive effective change, this is a valuable opportunity to join Frontline Support, a high performing team of diverse talents and backgrounds. As an Implementation Manager focussing on the Specialist Banking segment – covering key strategic areas like mortgages, protection and advice – you'll have the chance to work on a tremendous variety of initiatives, and will need to thrive on the constant challenge that brings.
Personal & Business Banking (PBB) exists to provide a helpful and straightforward banking service to over 16 million personal and small business customers in the UK. Our customers will account for around half of RBS's total business in the future, and we are committed to meeting their needs with straightforward products, helpful and convenient service, and good advice.
What you'll do
As Implementation Manager you'll take the leading role in making sure that all internally generated change across Specialist Banking is consistently developed, delivered and embedded, and lands in a way that meets the needs of both our customers and the bank. You'll work on initiatives that may range from relatively small product changes to major overhauls of the way we interact with our customers. You'll not only implement change, but also play a lead part in developing the solutions. The topics you cover will also bring variety, and may include remediation for complaints, regulatory change, or new product launches. Your interaction with other areas of the bank will be similarly diverse, and you may face off to areas like product, design or compliance teams.
You'll be recognised as a subject matter expert in embedding sustainable change across a range of themes, and can expect real accountability and recognition for the work you do.
What you'll bring
While you'll need to have a banking background, detailed knowledge of the Specialist Banking business isn't essential. In fact, the interdependencies involved in implementation mean that previous roles in an area such as technology, transformation, or control could be valuable.
Whatever your career history to date you'll need to be results focussed with a track record of project and programme delivery, and to have a sold understanding of risk management principles and methodologies, including reputational and regulatory risk. You'll need to back that up with a proven record of success in influencing and managing across a matrix environment. A relevant project management qualification, such as PRINCE2, could also prove an advantage.
Perhaps most importantly you'll thrive on the variety and challenge that this role offers, and will have the determination and tenacity to push initiatives through in the right way for the bank and our customers.
You'll augment all of this with proven communication and stakeholder management skills. You'll need to be able to influence colleagues at all levels, and will have the ability to construct concise arguments which frame risks and benefits in clear business terms.
As a Financial Services organisation we comply with and support the requirements set by our Regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which are designed to protect our customers. This role falls under Conduct Rules of the Individual Accountability Regime (IAR) and is subject to pre-employment screening. This means if your application is successful, you’ll need to satisfy some important background checks before you can start working with us. These will include a full credit check, a criminal record check, residency and right to work checks.
How we'll reward you
In return, we offer a competitive salary plus 30% cash and benefit funding programme that can be tailored to suit your individual needs. In addition, we provide a wide selection of exclusive lifestyle offers, development and learning programmes, services and support designed to help you manage and balance your work/life priorities. For more information on our benefits, please visit our website.
At RBS, we want everyone to feel welcome. That’s why we want you to know that we'll work with you to make the application process as smooth as possible. So please just let us know if you need any adjustments or support – we'll do whatever we can to help.
If we offer you a job, we’ll discuss with you how we can help set you up for success, including by making adjustments to your working environment if required.
If you are experiencing any technical issues when applying for this role, please refer to our FAQ section for assistance.
At RBS, we are focused on becoming the UK’s number one bank for customer service, trust and advocacy by 2020. We are simplifying our business, concentrating on the areas where we can lead the market, and placing our customers at the heart of everything we do."

This intellectually challenging role will give you the opportunity to guide the bank towards greater strength by uncovering vulnerabilities in our capital adequacy on both a local and business-wide basis. If you have good risk management experience and a strong quantitative base, joining us as a Capital Analytics Manager in Enterprise Wide Risk Management will give you a deep knowledge of stress testing and reverse stress testing frameworks, and broad exposure across our businesses and products.
Enterprise Wide Risk (EWR) deals with risks that manifest themselves at the aggregate level of the bank. So we take a strategic, bank-wide view of risk management.
We manage areas like capital and liquidity risk, which are entity driven (rather than pure credit, market or operational risk views), as well as risk appetite and policy framework which apply across the bank globally. We are a centre of expertise for all centralised risk model development activity, from stress testing to capital adequacy. We also own the end-to-end risk management framework, how it fits together, and work on its adoption and consistent application across the bank. This makes us a key area in delivering security to both customers and shareholders.
What you'll do
The Capital Analytics Team uses stress testing and reverse stress testing methodologies to investigate the capital adequacy and performance of portfolios and asset classes across all areas of the bank. We support with regulatory stress testing, but our primary focus is on internal intelligence, conducting reviews initiated by the team, or in response to requests from our customer businesses or senior committees.
As a Capital Analytics Manager, you'll conduct deep dive reviews of portfolios, assets and models, applying various economic scenarios to judge our capital adequacy, and identifying vulnerabilities in our P&L and balance sheets. We support all areas of the bank and conduct reviews cross-business, so you'll apply your expertise to a broad variety of products, lending books and portfolios. You'll also look into the performance of different products, evaluating return on investment to generate valuable business intelligence.
Your output will be high quality reports prepared for senior committees, presenting your findings as compelling conclusions on our underlying risks, and providing the early warning necessary to keep our businesses secure.
You'll achieve success in this role by:
Working with senior business risk specialists and risk senior management to drive delivery, and challenge our methodologies and assumptions, as well as the outcomes and implications of results
Providing independent review and challenge to stress testing results, focusing on their overall credibility, and comparing results and across and within different scenarios
Following industry trends to inform and deepen your understanding of credit capital risk
What you'll bring
This is highly quantitative work, and we're looking for someone with an educational and career track record that shows you're up to the task. An undergraduate degree in a quantitative discipline such as Mathematics, Financial Mathematics, Physics, or Statistics is essential, and further postgraduate study would be welcome. You should also hold a relevant professional qualification, such as CFA status at level 2 or above, PRM, or FRM, and have a working knowledge of accounting practices.
You'll need good experience in risk management or in a banking environment, and a track record working in credit risk, risk analytics, or as an equities analyst would be a good fit. Whatever your career history, you'll have a good understanding of stress testing, capital adequacy, P&L and balance sheets, as well as a broad knowledge of retail and wholesale credit products. Knowledge of Basel II and III would also be valuable, and may prove an advantage.
You'll round out your offering with strong interpersonal and communication skills, enabling you to engage effectively with business stakeholders, and produce high quality reports for senior management committees which distil complex analysis into meaningful conclusions.
As a Financial Services organisation we comply with and support the requirements set by our Regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which are designed to protect our customers. This role falls under Conduct Rules of the Individual Accountability Regime (IAR) and is subject to pre-employment screening. This means if your application is successful, you’ll need to satisfy some important background checks before you can start working with us. These will include a full credit check, a criminal record check, residency and right to work checks.
How we'll reward you
In return, we offer a competitive salary plus 30% cash and benefit funding programme that can be tailored to suit your individual needs. In addition, we provide a wide selection of exclusive lifestyle offers, development and learning programmes, services and support designed to help you manage and balance your work/life priorities.

If we offer you a job, we’ll discuss with you how we can help set you up for success, including by making adjustments to your working environment if required.
