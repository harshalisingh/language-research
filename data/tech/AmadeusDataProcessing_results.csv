Summary of the role
The Search, Shopping & Pricing division (SSP) is a division of approximately 350 people, spread over Nice, Boston and Bangalore, responsible for delivering high quality products related to pricing transactions, search engines for airlines (Air France, Lufthansa, British Airways, Air Canada…), online travel agencies (Opodo, eDreams, eBookers…) and metasearch (Kayak). Those products can be seen on either terminals (standard travel agencies, airports desks), well-known web sites or mobile applications.
Inside SSP, in order to solve a highly complex and constrained combinatory problematic, the Shopping Engines department is in charge of providing these products with sophisticated algorithms in a highly complex and constrained combinatory problematic and to make them evolve continuously to answer new business requirements.
The trainee will be part of one of the teams, which develops on the Shopping Engines and will work in close collaboration with developers.
Main responsibilities
One axis of improvement in the search engine is to decrease its CPU usage, and in particular to review its memory allocation algorithm and make it more efficient.
Today we are using two custom memory allocators:
A C memory allocator customized in order to limit the amount of memory allocated during one transaction and to ensure that all allocated memory is returned to the system between two transactions by releasing all system allocated memory. This allocator implements a first fit algorithm, whose performance drops when serving lot of small allocation/deallocation requests interspaced with large allocation requests.
Complemented by a C++ memory allocator for satisfying small allocation requests, due to aforementioned performance issue.
The goal of the internship will be to prototype a new allocator that could efficiently replace both allocators.
The internship will consist in several steps process:
Study state of the art
Prototype one or several custom allocators
Measurement of the gains and weaknesses of each prototype compared to legacy ones
Outcomes report & presentation
Requirements
Technical skills on C/C++ and especially memory allocation.
Analytical and synthetical thinking

Main responsibilities
The aim of the Shopping Engines is to provide the end user with travel solutions matching his request and fitting with the main criteria of a Fare Search: response time, cheapest price, book-ability and convenience.
One of the main concerns of our customers is the conversion rate, i.e. the ratio between searches & bookings in their business. The most important pillar of the conversion is the findability, i.e. the ability to propose the cheapest available solutions to a trip request.
The purpose of this internship is to improve the findability of our shopping product by optimizing the selection of the flights the shopping process will explore. This selection depends on various criteria based on flights and fares and is currently managed in a static way.
After a first phase of study of the selection module, the objective will be first to demonstrate the room for improvement of this module and then to optimize the way the criteria are handled in the module. One outcome of the internship will be to propose a prototype, which would define the best selection settings leading to the most significant findability improvement. The intern will develop this prototype in collaboration with the development team.

Main responsibilities:
As in every software development phase, validating a product is key factor that contributes to the quality of a product.
In Amadeus we are now moving from manual to automatic testing. Automatic tests are built using Geb & Spock that can playback different actions and scenarios thus ensuring full coverage and optimization of resources.
Automatic tests have become critical in the software development cycle of our Travel Agent Front End product and the new challenge that we face is monitoring our automatic test results. Thus, the topic proposed in this internship is to propose an intelligent way to efficiently monitor our automatic tests (300 – 500 tests). Today it takes us 4 hours a day to monitor 60 tests.
On top of this today we have numerous contributors to automatic tests that need to be handed over between the different phases of the software development life cycle. The aim is to implement an infrastructure which will allow the handover of tests between the different stages of the software lifecycle.
The goal of the apprenticeship is to also complete this framework by implementing different modules: order automatic tests according to a pre-defined classification, test coverage per functionality in order to be able to extend our test coverage intelligently.
The apprentice will also be in charge of the technical and functional design of the solution and must implement a prototype integrated in this framework.
Requirements:
Good development and analysis skills
Good knowledge on graphical interface web technologies
Good communication
Team spirit
Good level of english

We’re a high-performing, flexible team with the autonomy to achieve our mission, but accountable for how we do it. We develop simple, robust, working implementations of our visions that leave our clients wanting more. We strive to get validation for our ideas by partnering internally and externally, both with experts who can help us deliver a better product, and with customers, to get feedback on what we’re delivering.

Innovation Incubation Management
The Innovation Incubation Management team provides the tools, processes and support to help generate and manage new ideas. sandbox.amadeus.com
Our largest current project is the development of a suite of Restful APIs to expose Amadeus content and services from our latest projects and pilots, and those from our partners, in a way that’s engaging and easy to use. Ideally, software developers with little experience in travel should be able to integrate these APIs in their products in a matter of hours or days – not weeks or months. We deliver a variety of useful, interesting and innovative Amadeus content in a straightforward manner, to a diverse audience.
We also aim to research and improve API design, and the developer experience, and test it at events worldwide to see what this can enable. This program is designed, developed and operated by our group, check it out at https://sandbox.amadeus.com

Amadeus Benchmarking Engine (ABE) team is made of 5 engineers working in the airline revenue management (RM) area. The RM boosts the revenue of the airlines, and the ABE mission is to evaluate what are the best RM algorithms. How to do this? ABE provides different decision support tools based on a simulation platform. This platform embeds the real world-wide airline network and simulates the airlines revenue analysts with their strategies. What are the results? ABE can assess the impact of a given strategy or of a new RMS algorithm given a specific airline business. For example an overbooking strategy can be measured in term of expected revenue gain versus the risk of denying a passenger at boarding time.
Main Responsibilities:
How to simulate the airline customer? For how much and how does the customer wants to fly? For that ABE builds a customer demand model based on the airline hisotircal bookings (data mining and data scientists methods) and uses it to create demand of bookings (as close as possible to the reality).
How does it reflect the reality? For that ABE has built a module: for each simulated day a customer demand is generated and injected in the system. Then it compares the bookings done in the simulation to the one done in the real world. If the result differ, the demand model is customized to make it closer to the reality (eg: create more customer with a high willingness to pay). The operation is then reiterated several times; this process is called live-calibrator.
The goal of the apprenticeship is to improve the current live-calibrator module. Its objective are to assess the quality of the customer demand between each iteration (discrepancy with the real world) and to customize it for the next iteration. The apprenticeship may in a second phase introduce Machine learning technics to improve the customization of the demand. Finally a UI may be implemented so that the end-user can monitor the quality of the calibration. The UI is based on dashboards reporting performances in terms of iterations, running time, and calibrated factors. These dashboards are integrated in Django web framework with interactive charts such as Highcharts...
Requirements:
Good programming skills
Knowledge of Python or C++ is a plus.
Good communication skills

Amadeus Selling Platform Connect is the next generation of Front Office for Travel Agents for Amadeus with a fully web-based and unique solution.
For travel professionals, both novice and expert, who sell, advise and service leisure and business travelers.
Amadeus Selling Platform Connect is a one-stop shop for global Amadeus, and regional or local content, that is designed for the needs of the user and the business.
Unlike current available solutions, Amadeus Selling Platform Connect increases productivity, requires no installation, and can be tailored to customers specific needs
No other solution offers a fully automated tool to create travel offers, store them directly in the Booking File, send, track and confirm quotes.
Main responsibilities
Productivity Suite is a suite of tools used for enhancing the productivity of travel agents and ensuring the quality of travel agent activities. Productivity Suite is highly customizable and enables the office administrators to adapt Productivity Suite tool to travel agent needs. Productivity Suite is integrated in Amadeus Selling Platform Connect (SECO) and Altea Reservation Desktop Web (ARD Web).
Quality Monitor is a module of Productivity Suite, dedicated to checking the information of the booking and blocking the save if some information is missing. To create such rules, administrators of the travel agencies have access to a text editor, where they write their Quality Monitor scripts, based on a pre-defined grammar. In order to allow for more users to be able to create Quality Monitor rules, a graphical editor is needed, allowing agents with no scripting knowledge to write their own rules.
The trainee will help the team to analyze how the current grammar of Quality Monitor could be represented in a graphical way – also taking into account future evolutions of the module, as well as how other modules from Productivity Suite could evolve to benefit from this change. He will also participate in studying how existing tools/frameworks could be a basis for creating the editor. Based on this functional and technical study, the trainee will participate in implementing a prototype of the Quality Monitor graphical editor.

The internship is hosted in UI Development team of Sell Connect product in charge of development of air booking flow.
Main responsibilities
The goal of this internship is to participate in implementing a new way of displaying travel agency booking flows:
They must be configurable based on travel agent preferences.
Instead of having a ""static"" organization, it is proposed to split the functionalities in different independent components that can be mixed based on travel agent preferences and on defined rules (for ex for one travel agent component 1 must be displayed and used after component Z, for another travel agent only component X is used…).
This would create a ‘wizard’ approach on top of the application.
We propose here a new way of configuring the travel agent application to enable every travel agent to define the most useful flow/sequence of tasks for a given use case to serve... The tasks could be optional or mandatory. Moreover, the defined flow could delegate some of the defined tasks to other devices than the initial one (for instance delegating a tasks to the end traveler on a tablet), thus allowing to think synchronous or not, parallel or sequential…Offering all the possibilities of sequence a graphcet could describe.
The goal of this internship is to help the team to create a complete customizable tool to manage different flows, configure a rich states machine inside a web based application so to improve the user experience.
The trainee will participate in technical and functional design of the solution. Based on this, the trainee will help the team to implement a prototype and define the framework and guideline to ensure any component is compatible with this wizard and flow delegation approach.

Team Description:
Amadeus proposes an Internet Booking Engine (IBE) to airlines willing to sell their tickets online. This IBE is called e-Retail and is fully configurable to fulfil the airline online requirements. Our team is here to help and support our customers with its configuration. The Amadeus e-Retail solution allows of a lot of functionalities and combinations of settings allowing each airline to have a full interconnected and branded online solution.
In order to implement and test various configuration of the e-Retail Desktop and Mobile products, the team has developed and is maintaining an e-Retail portal simulator (historically called HTML shooter). The tool permits to test thousands of combinations.

He will drive some workshop with other team members to identify the usability traps of the current tool and build the roadmap for the development. Development will be done as well as automated test script writing. At the end of the internship, we must have a tool ready to be used by implementation team, and addressing the all the functionalities identified as ""mandatory"".

Shaping the future of travel has always been important to us at Amadeus. Today, with technology getting smarter by the minute, that future is more exciting than ever.
We work at the heart of the global travel industry. Amadeus offers you the opportunity to learn and grow and drive your own progression in an exciting and multicultural environment.
Our people are driven by a passion for 'Where next?' If you want to shape your career and the future of travel, Amadeus is the place for you.
Team Description
The Search Shopping and Pricing (SSP) division implements services for offering, pricing and selling air fares, and related services available through a service oriented architecture (SOA). Activities in this area include the development of cutting-edge fare search technology, the development of new major industry products and incorporating continuous technological advancements as new software and hardware platforms become available. SSP operates on an open system architecture implemented in C/C++, Java, Python... This provides a functional, cost-efficient, adaptable, scalable and robust platform – an asset for rising to the challenges offered by innovative shopping solutions and their inherent combinatorial complexity.
Within SSP, our department is responsible for the acquisition, storage, retrieval and matching of all the data used by the engines in the most efficient manner regarding time, memory and cpu. With the raising of the computational power required, SSP needs to take advantage of the cloud computing to better serve our customers.
Main responsibilities
In the context of deploying SSP servers in the cloud, we need to be able to perform data segregation so that only relevant data are forwarded to the right Data Center. When a data is missing from a remote Data Center, a request for this data will be sent from the remote Data Center to the central Data Center providing the data. When a new data is available in the central Data Center, it should be decided if the data has to be forwarded or not to the remote Data Centers. Each SSP Data can be identified by a key that is basically a string and based on the patterns of these keys, a Machine Learning should be able to predict if the data should be forwarded or not. The Machine Learning will be mainly fed by static rules (data not allowed to be forwarded) and dynamic events (requests from remote Data Centers).
The trainee will participate to the study of such Machine Learning based on Pattern Recognition. He will participate to build a proof of concept that demonstrates the feasibility and the accuracy of the predictions.
Requirements
Autonomy, good level of abstraction, ability to explain solutions clearly, ability to build a software proof of concept

We also own the Easy Tables framework, a key-value oriented framework widely used in Amadeus to store Amadeus applications’ configuration and applicative data.
With the Easy Table product, the Data Distribution Frameworks team provides a solution to access common data in very high read throughput and low write throughput manner. A good example of such data are the referential data (worldwide list or airports, worldwide list of countries …). In order to minimize the elapsed time of read access to this data, it is serialized from the main server as a file and then replicated locally on all applications filesystems. Today, this data is stored in SQLite databases. Sqlite is a versatile local database but it is not specifically tailored for high read throughput. There are innovative solution like lmdb or sparkey that could improve our solution.

Team description
Inventory Availability Calculation team is responsible for providing advanced availability calculation algorithms for Altea inventory airlines. Aim is to provide the right availability at the right person at the right time by taking into account the full context of the request. Additionally, we maintain some decision support tools describing the way the availability is computed on a given request.
Main Responsibilities
Amadeus is looking to enhance its quality assurance processes throughout its products.
The intern would participate in analyzing existing inventory and availability calculation functionalities, choosing the ones that could benefit more from Monkey Testing methodology and work on a tool to generate testing scripts and implement them.
What is Monkey testing methodology?
Monkey testing is a software testing technique in which the testing is performed on the system under test randomly. The Input data that is used to test are also generated randomly and keyed into the system. This type of testing should be automated and simple to launch. In fact, there are 2 types of monkey testing, one is called “smart monkey” and the other is much more dumb called “stupid monkey” and both do randomness.
Throughout the internship period, the trainee should begin by help the team to implement a stupid monkey and then try to enhance it by getting more functional knowledge of the Availability and Inventory features, so that at the end of the internship he/she gets a “smarter monkey” able to detect some core functional issues. All in all, “dumb monkeys” are used to detect bugs like UI crashes… whereas “smart monkeys” are used to detect much more specific functional issues, keeping in mind that “smart monkey” testing will never replace the “Gorilla*” testing we do today.
This internship is full of challenges, functional-wise, quality-wise and implementation-wise. These knowledge should be acquired at the end of the internship period.
* Gorilla testing is a technique in which repetitive Manual Testing process, which a tester would have done several times before, is done again to test the robustness of the system. Also called non-regression tests
Requirements
Knowledge on algorithms, scripting, coding and software validation process would be a bonus.
The trainee should have good analytical and interpersonal skills because he will be communicating with many different person in many different teams.

Main Responsibilities
Amadeus Payment Platforms (APP) is today accessible by merchants via SOAP web services or EDIFACT services.
REST is the newcomer to the block. It seeks to fix the problems with SOAP and provide a truly simple method of accessing Web services.
In particular REST is adapted to web/mobile technologies: REST uses HTTP 1.1 verbs (GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE) to perform tasks (CRUD operations). The content is JSON and not XML so really more convenient to use like from Javascript; JSON is natively supported by browser clients. REST is known to be more efficient than SOAP (Caching). REST is less verbose than XML so more understandable by humans. Putting it in a more global picture, JSON is more and more used for storage (MongoDB), adapted to serialize dynamic key/values structures etc…
Modern payment providers like Paypal provide RESTFul APIs. Why not Amadeus?
This is also a trend in Amadeus to provide REST versions of all our services to customers, TEST sandbox etc…
The intern will help the team to:
Define REST interfaces compliant with web and Amadeus standards
Design the architecture, typically deciding between supporting natively REST in APP or addition of a translation application converting REST services to standard SOAP/EDIFACT services
Implement first set of payment services in REST
Open them to Amadeus TEST sandbox
Potentially build a proof of concept with one of the Amadeus frontend calling APP with REST services
Testing and documentation
Requirements
Programming Skills: C++ , Python, Web technologies.
Fluent English

Team Description
The Application Configuration Frameworks (ACF) team aims at providing generic solutions for business configuration for all Amadeus solutions. Part of its activities is to develop a configuration application to give consistency between the different configuration providers (Rule Engines, Key-Value Configuration tables)
The Configuration Core Engine is the corporate configuration framework that is widely used by applications to modify dynamically the behavior of their product.
Configuration models are key elements and are considered as critical for Amadeus depending on which flow they are involved in or which application use them: if a configuration item is not available or corrupted for the boarding or the pricing it can impact the passenger and affect the revenue of our customers.
Today this notion of criticality is not known and Amadeus does not have a global view that would make us able to detect the impact that could cause a wrong application in the Amadeus business.
Main Responsibilities
Amadeus proposes many products that offer a big number of different functionalities. Each functionality needs to be implemented for a specific client and can be customized to behave exactly in a way that matches the level of personalization awaited by the client.
The very first step of the implementation process is the functionality enabling. The AAF (Amadeus Activation Framework) is a brand new tool that allows to enable/disable functionalities in the scope of some particular use cases.
Given the enormous amount of functionalities offered by Amadeus’ applications, there is a strong need to be able to know for a specific client which are exactly all the functionalities that are enabled and which are not. In the same way, for a given functionality we would need to have a full and clear picture of all the use cases (per client) for which the functionality is enabled.
Moreover, functionality enabling is only the first step to be done to implement a functionality for a customer, many other configurations needs to be set-up in order to have the functionality up-and-running.
The goal of this internship is to participate in following activities:
- build a prototype that provides a comprehensive view of functionalities activated per client in AAF
- build a prototype that provides a comprehensive view of clients that have subscribed a given functionality in AAF
- build a prototype that allows to automatize the implementation flow for a functionality.
In order to do that the candidate should help the team to conduct interviews with Product Managers and Implementation teams to collect the business needs and requirements for the prototypes and identify a functionality that could be the center of the automatized implementation flow. Starting from the requirements the candidate should help the team to define the functional specifications and the user interface design. Finally, the candidate should help the team to build the prototypes according to what specified.

Team Description
The concept of Business Rules is one of the main new trends of the IT and one of its major standards. It enables a product to define and customize a business process with a list of functional criteria based on entities such as markets, flight groups, point of sale, regardless of any development constraints.
The Amadeus Business Rules (ABR) product is the central repository for all the functional logics in the heart of Altéa Suite: Altéa Inventory & Altéa Departure Control used today by a huge number of airlines. Currently more and more Amadeus products (Electronic ticketing, EOT, Advertising Server, Availability process) are defining their logics with ABR.
Main Responsibilities
The ABR rule evaluation engine is the core of the ABR framework. In order to provide under-millisecond response time, it relies on binary memory-mapped cache files where the data is stored along with several indexing structures. In a large distributed infrastructure, however, the generation, synchronization and inspection of such cache files become increasingly complex and fault prone tasks.
The goal of this internship is to help the team to prototype a replacement for the ABR cache framework based on emerging NoSQL technologies, such as CouchBase, that allow to transparently handle the replication of data on multiple nodes.
The trainee will participate in following activities:
Design an appropriate NoSQL data model able to effectively store ABR data;
Adapt the ABR evaluation engine to rely on the NoSQL data store;
Prototype and benchmark the solution.
Requirements
Excellent level in C++
Knowledge of NoSQL technologies is a plus
Analytical Thinking
Adaptation
Good communication skills
Synthetic Thinking
Fluent English is necessary

Team Description
Amadeus is a world leader in providing IT solutions for the whole travel industry. It provides a comprehensive set of products for managing airline business, spanning from reservation to operational systems and managing both passengers and aircrafts at the airport. Within this set of applications, our department is in charge of the customer management and loyalty systems, providing the IT tools to positively influence customer behaviour.
Learning about the customer and using this knowledge in all customer interactions is today a major trend in all industries and our activities are developing quickly. We are part of the Airline IT division (running the largest data centre in Europe!): giving us access to a huge set of valuable airline customer data worldwide.
Technically, we are developing large-scale applications, in fully distributed environment (SOA, clustering…), using state of the art technologies (Linux, Oracle, “in memory’’ databases…).
The team activities are fully integrated in “agile” model, including both developers and product analysts. We are also closely working with the data centre teams and the marketing. This is a perfect opportunity to learn about different specialties in the IT industry.
Main Responsibilities
The airline industry and gamification, or the use of game mechanics in non-gaming contexts, have historically had a close relationship. The first ever use of any form of gamification started in 1981 when American Airlines introduced the first frequent flyer program named “AAdvantage”. Since then, the use of gamification has become more common and is steadily moving towards a significant 5.5 billion market share by 2018.
Purpose of the internship is now to take advantage of mobile technologies to go further in the concept and to introduce new kind of Gamifications which will enhance customer experience and engagement. Indeed, thanks to mobile phones we have a high level of interaction with the customer, with the ability to suggest games at the right time (for example when he’s waiting for a flight at the airport), at the right place (for example in the airport lounge).
Indoor geolocalisation, basing on iBeacons, could also be a good way to interact closely with the customer, and propose games such as “Treasure Hunts”.
The first part of the internship will consist to help the team to brainstorm and find new innovative ideas of Gamification applicable to the Airline Loyalty domain.
The second part will consist in participate in the implementation of a working prototype, including analysis, definition, design and development tasks.
The scope of the prototype will include the implementation of the mobile application as well as the full integration with the existing Loyalty System to offer a more comprehensive view of the software engineering activity, from low-level technical development to the business aspects.
The project details will be discussed during the interview, taking into account candidate areas of interest in the scope of Customer Management Area, Mobile Application Development and Gamification.
The team will provide full technical support on the existing platform for the end-to-end use case, relevant data set for experimentation and access to previous studies and prototypes in this area that demonstrated the validity of this approach.
Regarding the technical environment, there is no specific prerequisite: for Amadeus standard technology, appropriate training/support will be provided and we have some flexibility on the technical stack selection.
Requirements
Master degree in Computer Science or related technical field or equivalent experience.
English
Interest for software design and development
Organization, communication and team player.
Information gathering, problem solving.

We are part of the Airline IT division (running the largest data centre in Europe!): giving us access to a huge set of valuable airline customer data worldwide.
Technically, we are developing large-scale applications, in fully distributed environment (SOA, clustering…), using state of the art technologies (Linux, Oracle, “in memory’’ databases…).
The team activities are fully integrated in “agile” model, including both developers and product analysts. We are also closely working with the data centre teams and the marketing. This is a perfect opportunity to learn about different specialties in the IT industry.
Main Responsibilities
Purpose of the internship is to facilitate the financial transactions between Airline Loyalty Programs, their Members and their Partner Programs. In the current state of Frequent Flyer Programs, members may face difficulties attempting to gain benefits from the different Partners affiliated with their preferred airline. Indeed, many of these Partners can be small, localised, specialised or exclusive providers with unique offers but with limited technical infrastructure preventing secure automated integration with the Loyalty Program.
The project aim is ease this integration using the advanced technology that is now commonly available through the widespread use of mobile devices and smartphones. NFC technology, adopted by the mobile payment solutions Google Wallet and Apple Pay, provides a secure and reliable manner to manage the financial transactions of members when interacting with the myriad Partners of their airlines loyalty program.
The project details will be discussed during the interview, taking into account candidate areas of interest in the scope of Secure Payment Processing, Financial Reconciliation, potential for NFC technology, Mobile Application Development or Responsive Design.
With the support of a referent engineer, the trainee will participate in:
- the analysis,
- the definition,
- the design,
- and the implementation of a working prototype.
The scope of the prototype will include the implementation of mobile applications and NFC communication as well as the full integration with the existing Loyalty System to offer a more comprehensive view of the software engineering activity, from low-level technical development to the business aspects.
The team will provide full technical support on the existing platform for the end-to-end use case, relevant data set for experimentation and access to previous studies and prototypes in this area that demonstrated the validity of this approach.
Regarding the technical environment, there is no specific prerequisite: for Amadeus standard technology, appropriate training/support will be provided and we have some flexibility on the technical stack selection.
